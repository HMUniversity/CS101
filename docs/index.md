# About the course (HMU-1.101)

Welcome to computer science. Computer science has developed rapidly in recent years, but with the courses of good and bad, we must rely on self-study if we want to really learn computer efficiently. A real computer scientist must have the courage to step into the door of computer alone.

We provide a computer self-study path. If you are a novice or a rookie, you can learn according to this self-study path. We sincerely hope you can make achievements in the computer industry.

> Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done. (Linus)

This is an introductory course for beginners, but even people who are proficient in computers can use it as a reference book.
